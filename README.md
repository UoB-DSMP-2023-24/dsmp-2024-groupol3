## Databricks

Databricks is a cloud-based data tool for processing, manipulating and transforming data. As well as its data engineering use cases, we can explore insights into data using machine learning models. I decided to use Databricks as its notebooks have version history, the ability to switch between SQL & Python and collaborate dynamically with other workers. For more information, please take a look at their website.

## Transforming the dataset into a table.

Due to being more familiar with SQL, I created a table for the given dataset. Once cleaned, I can then start exploring potential insights within the data. The notebook has been uploaded to the GitHub 'Databricks Lloyds Table'; however, the Databricks link below has a user-friendly UI.

## Databricks Notebook

I will be conducting data manipulation and exploration within a Databricks notebook. This can be accessed via a published link, or developers can be granted access to make updates and view live changes.
